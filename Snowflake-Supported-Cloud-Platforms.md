# Snowflake Editions and Supported Cloud Platforms

Snowflake provides different editions so organizations can choose what suits their needs. Each edition adds more features on top of the previous one. Each successive edition builds on the previous edition by adding edition-specific features or higher levels of service. If requirements change, it is easy to switch to another edition.

## Overview of Snowflake Editions

### Standard Edition
Standard Edition is the basic edition and includes all the core Snowflake features. It offers a good balance between cost, support, and functionality.

### Enterprise Edition
Enterprise Edition includes everything in Standard Edition. It adds more features designed for large organizations that need enhanced performance and better control.

### Business Critical Edition
Business Critical Edition includes all Enterprise Edition features, along with stronger security and data protection. It is suitable for organizations handling highly sensitive data such as PHI. It also supports account failover and failback for business continuity and disaster recovery.
### Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS)
VPS includes all the features of Business Critical Edition but runs in a completely isolated Snowflake environment with dedicated hardware. It is designed for financial institutions and organizations with strict security requirements.

## Supported Cloud Platforms

Snowflake runs completely on cloud infrastructure. All three layers of Snowflake’s architecture storage, compute, and cloud service operate on the selected cloud platform.

A Snowflake account can be hosted on:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Google Cloud (GCP)
- Microsoft Azure

Each cloud platform has multiple regions where Snowflake accounts can be provisioned.

Organizations can choose the same cloud platform they already use, or select a different one depending on business needs.
